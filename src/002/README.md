# Problem 2
## Even Fibonacci Numbers

---

### Description

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

<span style='text-align: center'>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</span>

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Explanation of Solution

There is not really any good way to go about this problem other than a brute
force solution. Fortunately, there are some patterns we can observe.

Take the first 10 terms provided by the problem:

<span style='text-align: center'>1, <span style='color: red'>2</span>, 3, 5,
<span style='color: red'>8</span>, 13, 21, <span style='color: red'>34</span>,
55, 89, ...</span>

I've highlighted the even-valued terms in red. We can see that every 3 terms,
there is a new even-valued terms. We can capitalize on this by not checking
every term generated by our Fibonacci algorithm and rather just adding every
3<sup>rd</sup> term to our sum.
